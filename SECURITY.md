## Security model

`pi-web-kit` is a Pi package. Pi extensions execute with the same permissions as the local user running Pi. Users should review installed Pi packages and only install packages from sources they trust.

`pi-web-kit` sends search queries and fetched URLs to the configured third-party provider. Page content returned by providers is cached in memory for the lifetime of the Pi process, subject to TTL and size limits. API keys are read from environment variables or local config files and are used only for provider requests. Do not commit API keys, tokens, or config files containing secrets.

The extension validates URLs before fetch calls and only accepts `http:` and `https:` URLs without embedded credentials. This validation reduces accidental misuse but does not sandbox provider responses or the local Pi process.
